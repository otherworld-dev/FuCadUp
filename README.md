### A Fusion 360-style fork of FreeCAD

FuCad is a fork of [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org), the open-source parametric
3D modeler. It keeps FreeCAD's geometry kernel, document model, Python API and
`.FCStd` file format intact, and reworks the user experience along the lines of
Fusion 360: a unified, task-driven interface instead of a workbench-per-discipline
layout.

Because the core is unchanged, FuCad opens existing FreeCAD documents and runs
existing FreeCAD macros and addons.

The name contracts **Fu**sion and Free**CAD**; the *Up* stands for
**U**nified **P**arametric — Fusion's task-driven workflow over FreeCAD's
parametric core.

Status
------

FuCad is an early-stage fork under active development. There are no precompiled
releases yet; build from source.

Compiling
---------

FuCad uses FreeCAD's build system unchanged. See the
[Developers Handbook – Getting Started](https://freecad.github.io/DevelopersHandbook/gettingstarted/)
for platform-specific build instructions and dependencies.

Underlying technology
---------------------

* **OpenCASCADE** — the geometry kernel
* **Coin3D** — Open Inventor-compliant 3D scene representation
* **Python** — broad scripting API, compatible with FreeCAD's
* **Qt** — graphical user interface

Reporting issues
----------------

Report problems with FuCad on the [FuCad issue tracker](https://github.com/FadyFaheem/FuCad/issues).

If you can reproduce the same problem in upstream FreeCAD, please report it to the
[FreeCAD issue tracker](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues) instead, so the
fix benefits both projects.

Usage & getting help
--------------------

FuCad's scripting API and core concepts are FreeCAD's, so the FreeCAD documentation
applies:
