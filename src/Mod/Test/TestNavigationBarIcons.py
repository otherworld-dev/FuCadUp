"""GUI regression tests for the colour of the navigation bar's icons.

The bar floats over the canvas carrying stock FreeCAD view icons, which draw their
geometry in a cyan family (#16d0d2, #34e0e2, #2bdbdd) that has nothing to do with
the accent the rest of the fork's chrome is painted in. The bar therefore recolours
the icons it shows onto the accent hue.

The recolour has to happen on the buttons. The QActions behind them are the shared
command actions the ribbon and the menus show as well, so writing to those would
drag the new colour across the whole application.

To run tests:
