"""Set preferences for the length of a GUI test, then put them back as they were.

A GUI test that depends on a preference has to set it rather than trust it. A
long-lived profile carries values that a fresh one never has, and a test run
starts from a fresh one on CI. Three suites passed for months on a developer's
machine and failed on every clean profile for that reason:

- the FuCad Dark preference pack is never applied during a test run, since the
  first-start theme selector that would apply it returns early for one, so its
  colours and stylesheet were only there because the profile had saved them;
- a default the fork has since changed (DatumScale went from 100 to 300) was only
  right where the profile stored it explicitly, and a test that recomputed it with
  the old fallback got the old answer everywhere else.

PinnedPreferences snapshots each entry it is given, including whether it existed
at all, sets the pinned value, and restore() puts every one back exactly: an entry
that was absent is removed rather than left behind with a value.
