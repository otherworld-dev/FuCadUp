"""GUI regression tests for FuCad's flat solid modelling icons.

The icons live under :/icons/fucad with the same names as the stock ones they
replace, and BitmapFactory searches there before :/icons, so a command, a tree
item and a timeline marker all get the flat icon without any of them changing.
That only holds while the search order does, which is what these tests check: the
icon handed out for each name has to be the flat one, not the stock one.

To run tests:
    FreeCAD -t TestFuCadIcons
