"""Reading the Operation property out of a document FreeCAD wrote.

Upstream FreeCAD gives each feature class only the operations it can perform:
an additive feature offers {"Union"}, a subtractive one {"Subtraction",
"Common"}. FuCadUp offers all four operations on every feature, because one
tool is both. A document stores the index into the list, so the numbering does
not line up and a pocket saved by FreeCAD as index 0 would read here as Join
and quietly turn into a pad.

FreeCAD builds those short lists as custom enumerations, which means the value
names travel with the document. That is what these tests lean on, and it is
what the migration reads instead of the index. Assigning a sequence to the
property is exactly how a custom enumeration is made, so the documents saved
below are byte-for-byte what FreeCAD writes.
