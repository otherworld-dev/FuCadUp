 * providers built, which is what makes the ring follow the selection without
 * knowing anything about it. Whatever does not fit in the ring stays reachable
 * through a last entry that opens that same menu unchanged.

 * The colours are properties rather than a stylesheet rule because the ring is
 * painted rather than composed of widgets; a theme sets them with qproperty-.
