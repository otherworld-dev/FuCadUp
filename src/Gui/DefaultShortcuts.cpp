/**
 * Fusion reaches its tools with a bare letter, where FreeCAD reserves those for
 * the sketch constraints and gives the tools a G or K prefix. The letters go to
 * the tools here, and the constraints that held them move into the K prefix
 * their siblings already use.
 *
 * Modelling and sketching can share a letter because only one of the two is ever
 * enabled: a sketch constraint needs a sketch open, and a modelling command needs
 * one closed. The shortcut framework hands the key to whichever is live.
 *
 * A Fusion letter also has to win against every longer chord it happens to
 * prefix (S against "S, B"/"S, F"/"S, G"/"S, D", C against the old bare-C
 * constraint chords, and so on) instead of waiting ShortcutTimeout for one of
 * those chords to complete. `ShortcutManager::checkShortcut` resolves that by
 * priority: giving every entry here `fuCadPriority` below is what lets its
 * exact match fire immediately, ahead of any enabled longer sequence with a
 * lower priority. Modelling commands that must stay off while a sketch is
 * open (PartDesign's tools, `Std_Placement`, `Std_Measure`) are guarded in
 * their own `isActive()` instead of here.
