/**
 * Fusion style history strip: one marker per modelling feature of the active
 * body, in creation order, with a playhead that rolls the model back by moving
 * the tip of the body.
 *
 * The strip is filled from the active PartDesign body of the active document.
 * PartDesign is not linked from Gui, so the body is recognised by type name and
 * read and written through its Group, Tip and BaseFeature properties, which
 * keeps the timeline out of the module dependency graph. Outside a body the
 * strip falls back to the Part features of the document in dependency order,
 * which has no tip and therefore no playhead.
 *
 * One step of the playhead is one undo entry: the tip and the visibility of the
 * sketches and datums the step rolls past are written inside a single
 * transaction. Which features the strip hid is remembered in the RollbackHidden
 * property of the body's view provider rather than in the widget, so it is saved
 * with the document and survives both a reload and a switch to another body.
 *
 * Nothing here holds a document object across event loop turns: features are
 * remembered by internal name and resolved again on use, and every rebuild is
 * deferred through a timer so that it never runs inside a document signal.
