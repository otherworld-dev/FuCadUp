 * The geometry of FuCadUp's view cube (SoViewCube), worked out without a scene
 * graph or GL so that it can be checked on its own.
 *
 * The cube spans -1..1 on each axis, with the faces as SoNaviCube has them: Top
 * +z, Front -y, Left -x, Rear +y, Right +x, Bottom -z. A pick id's direction is
 * the sum of the normals of the faces it touches, so FrontTop is (0, -1, 1).
